        # UX Flow / Dev Backlog

        *** Transform the comments below into code one feature at a time. ***
        *** The comments below depict a potential UX flow. ***
        *** Working on them in "chronological order" is likely not the best approach. ***

        ## As a Tutorial, the User is presented the Daily Backlog that contains THREE Tasks

        - Task ONE
            - User modifies Task Name
            - User marks Task as Complete
        - Task TWO
            - User Cancels Task
        - Task THREE
            - User assigns a Context
                - Context options are: Live, Learn, Earn, Love        
            - User indicates Task as Top Of Mind

        ## User is then presented the Top Of Mind

        - The Top Of Mind displays the Top Of Mind Task from each Context (FOUR Tasks total)
            - There can only be ONE Top Of Mind Task per Context

        ## User is returned to Daily Backlog

        - User creates THREE Tasks- ONE for each remaining Context

        ## User Exits the program
