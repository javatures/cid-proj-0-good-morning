# Project 0: ghuD Morning

***Every great day starts with a ghuD Morning***

- **A Java CLI (command-line interface) application.**
- **Operated by user input**
- **Persisted by PostgreSQL**
- **Managed by Git**

## TLDR

**ghuD:** "Great Heads Up Display"
**Feels Like:** A task manager app
**Domain:** Quotidian- the day-to-day data... for the day.
**Objective:** Clarify thoughts, clear mind, repeat...

## ghuD System

Less is less- not more. If anything, less is nothing, and nothing is space- which is a ghuD thing.

The ghuD System encourages presence by honing user focus in on what's presently important- not yesterday or tomorrow, just the present.

Aside from ghuD Morning, there are countless ways to implement the ghuD System in your daily life- most preferably with nothing, followed closely by pen and paper.
