# Project 0 In A Nutshell

A young task management program that aspires to one day be a full grown Linux distribution.

## App: Good Morning

***Because every great day starts with a good morning.***

**Let's have a healthy relationship with technology.**

*keep important things top of mind... but only long enough to clear your head.*

Use it to Live, Learn, Earn and Love. \
Earning is the only place here that you don't wanna take an L- but even if you do...
